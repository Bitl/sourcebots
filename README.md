# SourceBots

SourceBots is an Artificial Intelligence system to create Bots in:

* [Source SDK 2013](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013)
* [Alien Swarm](https://github.com/Sandern/aswscratch)

## What is the difference between a Bot and an NPC?

As its name indicates, an NPC (**non-player character**) is a character that can interact with the player but is not taken as one, so you can not perform certain actions on it, such as: view it in spectator mode, display it in the players list, etc.

Instead, a Bot is the Artificial Intelligence in charge of thinking and "inject" commands _(move the mouse, press buttons)_ that would make a human player.

Public versions of Source Engine only have an A.I. to create NPC's, SourceBots allows you to have another A.I. to create Bots.

## Alpha version!

The current system is in an Alpha and is not recommended to be deployed in a mod release. It is possible to encounter bugs, memory leaks and incomplete functions.

Use the current version to **test the system and improve it**, among all we can achieve a stable and complete version.

You can report bugs, suggestions and improvements [here](https://github.com/WootsMX/SourceBots/issues).
